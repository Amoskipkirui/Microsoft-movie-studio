# Movie Studio Analysis

This repository contains documentation and code for the movie studio analysis project conducted by Microsoft. The aim of the project is to explore the types of films that are currently performing well at the box office and provide actionable insights and recommendations for Microsoft's new movie studio.

## Project Overview
Microsoft has decided to venture into the movie industry and create a new movie studio. However, they lack knowledge and understanding of the movie business. The project focuses on analyzing various movie datasets to gain insights into successful films at the box office. The analysis aims to answer key questions and provide recommendations for the type of films Microsoft should create.

The project involves the following steps:

1. Business Understanding: Identify key questions and goals for the project, including the influence of studios, film genres, production budget, star presence, producer impact, movie ratings, runtime, original language, and correlations with box office performance.
2. Data Collection: Obtain movie datasets from sources such as Box Office Mojo, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers.
3. Data Preprocessing: Clean the datasets, handle missing values, and convert data types as necessary.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the data to understand the relationship between studios, genres, production budget, stars, producers, ratings, runtime, original language, and box office performance.
5. Visualization: Create visualizations, such as histograms, bar graphs, and heatmaps, to illustrate the findings.
6. Insights and Recommendations: Draw insights from the analysis and provide data-driven recommendations for Microsoft's movie studio.
7. Conclusion: Summarize the key findings and propose next steps for Microsoft's movie studio.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
In conclusion, the analysis of the movie datasets has provided insights into successful films at the box office. The findings suggest that studios, genres, production budget, star presence, producers, ratings, runtime, and original language can all impact box office performance. Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made for Microsoft's new movie studio:

1. Collaborate with established studios or production companies that have a track record of box office success.
2. Focus on genres such as action, adventure, comedy, animation, and drama, which tend to have high box office performance.
3. Allocate a sufficient production budget to ensure higher quality films.
4. Consider casting stars from other fields to attract a broader audience.
5. Collaborate with top film producers to enhance international success and box office performance.
6. Pay attention to movie ratings, as positive reception can influence box office success.
7. Optimize film runtime to balance storytelling and box office revenue.
8. Create films in popular genres to increase the likelihood of box office success.
9. Consider the popularity of movies based on their original language for targeted marketing and distribution.
10. Analyze correlations between attributes and box office/revenue generated to inform decision-making.

Going forward, Microsoft's movie studio should continuously monitor industry trends, audience preferences, and emerging factors to adapt and optimize their movie production strategies for long-term success.
